Description: Provides various statistical methods for
  designing and analyzing randomized experiments. One functionality
  of the package is the implementation of randomized-block and
  matched-pair designs based on possibly multivariate pre-treatment
  covariates. The package also provides the tools to analyze various
  randomized experiments including cluster randomized experiments,
  two-stage randomized experiments, randomized experiments with 
  noncompliance, and randomized experiments with missing data.
