\title{Estimation of the Average Treatment Effect in Randomized Experiments}
\usage{
ATEnocov(Y, Z, data = parent.frame(), match = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{The outcome variable of interest.}

\item{Z}{The (randomized) treatment variable. This variable should be
binary.}

\item{data}{A data frame containing the relevant variables.}

\item{match}{A variable indicating matched-pairs. The two units in the same
matched-pair should have the same value.}
}
\value{
A list of class \code{ATEnocov} which contains the following items:
\item{call}{ The matched call.  } \item{Y}{ The outcome variable.  }
\item{Z}{ The treatment variable.  } \item{match}{ The matched-pair
indicator variable.  } \item{ATEest}{ The estimated average treatment
effect.  } \item{ATE.var}{ The estimated variance of the average treatment
effect estimator.  } \item{diff}{ Within-pair differences if the
matched-pair design is analyzed.  }
}
\description{
This function computes the standard ``difference-in-means'' estimate of the
average treatment effect in randomized experiments without using
pre-treatment covariates. The treatment variable is assumed to be binary.
Currently, the two designs are allowed: complete randomized design and
matched-pair design.
