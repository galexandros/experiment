\arguments{
\item{formulae}{A list of formulae where the first formula specifies the
(pre-treatment) covariates in the outcome model (the latent compliance
covariate will be added automatically), the second formula specifies the
compliance model, and the third formula defines the covariate specification
for the model for missing-data mechanism (the latent compliance covariate
will be added automatically). For the outcome model, the formula should take
the two-sided standard R \command{formula} where the outcome variable is
specified in the left hand side of the formula which is then separated by
\code{~} from the covariate equation in the right hand side, e.g., \code{y ~
x1 + x2}. For the compliance and missing-data mechanism models, the
one-sided \command{formula} should be used where the left hand side is left
unspecified, e.g., \code{~ x1 + x2}.}

\description{
This function estimates the average causal effects for randomized
experiments with noncompliance and missing outcomes under the assumption of
latent ignorability (Frangakis and Rubin, 1999). The models are based on
Bayesian generalized linear models and are fitted using the Markov chain
Monte Carlo algorithms. Various types of the outcome variables can be
analyzed to estimate the Intention-to-Treat effect and Complier Average
Causal Effect.
}
\details{
For the details of the model being fitted, see the references. Note that
when always-takers exist we fit either two logistic or two probit models by
first modeling whether a unit is a complier or a noncomplier, and then
modeling whether a unit is an always-taker or a never-taker for those who
are classified as non-compliers.
